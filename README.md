Sribo.

a simple macOS app to help you write more. and get distracted less.

how to use:
open with Xcode. select 'Sign to run locally' in the Signing & Capabilities tab.


open source proj. feel free to fork & push to make Scribo better. whether it's running local LLMs on it (something we'll add soon anyways) or just customizing it for your own use cases.
